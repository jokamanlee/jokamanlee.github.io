        “Ways of Seeing” brings up a really interesting point in the beginning about how in the past, people 
        had to physically move and go see what the wanted to, such as art, but now everything can come to 
        us. Technology, for example the camera is able to capture images and allow for it to travel to us. 
        However, what I never realized until watching this documentary is how this reproduction of this image 
        changes the meaning of the original in many ways. To me, a reproduction, especially with the technology 
        that we have these days is just a copy of the original, so the meaning wouldn’t change. However, the 
        documentary goes on to explain the small changes that are made to reproductions that we don’t even realize
        sometimes, and these changes sometimes makes the original meaning change. I do agree with the idea that
        many things we see today are usually comprised of other people’s work, and many people would manipulate 
        the meaning of such works to help support their own. There is so much manipulation that happens to original 
        works, sometimes we don’t even realize it is happening, and I find this to be very true. Something that was 
        also mentioned by John Berger is how our interpretations of many things is affected by our experiences, and 
        this might hinder our ability to find the original meaning. However, the main point, which I agree with is 
        many things we see today is arranged in a way to convey a certain meaning and this might not always be the 
        original meaning, and how everyone should be aware of this.
