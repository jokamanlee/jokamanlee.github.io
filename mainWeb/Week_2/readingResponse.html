            In As We May Think by Vannevar Bush, it starts off as around the idea that technology and science is becoming a 
            tool for destruction rather than a tool to enhance our knowledge. He goes on to explain how technology has advanced
             and begins to explain his predictions of how it would go even further. Bush then talks about this term he coined, 
             "memex", relating to the memory and index of information. Where technology becomes a storage for knowledge, where 
             everything becomes interconnected and such knowledge can be accessible easily. This is very similar to what we would 
             call the web, which pretty much became a storage for information, and very similar to Bush's prediction of such mapped 
             out system. However, being published in 1945, Bush seemed to almost predict the future, and this was amazing.

                If we were to jump to the 21st century, where the web actually existed, in Long Live the Web by Tim-Berners-Lee 
                explains how the web was now changing from its original purpose. The web is now being exploited by organizations 
                and companies. The web is changing from its original purpose, an open source of knowledge to becoming a source 
                used for money making. There isn't as much freedom on the web and people are being oppressed and watched on it.
                 Tim-Berners Lee doesn't believe the web or the internet should be headed to this kind of future, and I agree it 
                 shouldn't either. The web should be what Vannevar Bush predicted, an open source of knowledge for everyone, where 
                 everyone can access; with the right to privacy.
